### Getting Started[​](https://ags816710.github.io/rcd/docs/setup#getting-started) <a href="#getting-started" id="getting-started"></a>

Open the baseplate in Roblox Studio

You should be able to see the map eventually load in (if you have a slower computer, it might take a bit longer for it to work!)

If it doesn't load and just isn't responding or is just crashing, your computer **is not** a high enough spec to run Ridgeway in studio!

Make sure to publish the game by going to Game Settings > Save to Roblox > Save\
Find your game's place id and remember or save it for later!\
( One way to find your game's id is to run `print(game.PlaceId)` and copy the result from output! )

After publishing make sure to go to Game Settings>Security and enable both "Allow HTTP Requests" and "Enable Studio Access to API Services"

If you would like to give yourself developer permissions go to\
ServerScriptService>Services>RemoteService:37 & ServerScriptService>Services>DataService:13\
And add your **userId** into the Developer tables!
